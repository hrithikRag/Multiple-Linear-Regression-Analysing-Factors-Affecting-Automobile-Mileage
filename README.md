**Project Title: Analyzing Factors Affecting Automobile Mileage using Multiple Linear Regression**

**Description:**

This GitHub repository presents an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing automobile mileage through the application of Multiple Linear Regression, implemented in R. The primary objective of this project is to quantitatively assess the impact of various features on vehicle fuel efficiency, enabling data-driven insights for automobile manufacturers and consumers.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Feature Impact Assessment:** We conducted a thorough examination of multiple features to understand their individual contributions to automobile mileage. This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that have the most significant influence on fuel efficiency.

- **Model Selection:** To arrive at the most optimal model given the dataset, we employed two distinct approaches. First, we compared models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score, aiming to identify the model with the best fit. Second, we performed manual feature elimination through hypothesis testing to refine the model further.

- **Predictive Utility:** We evaluated the model's effectiveness for prediction, ensuring that it could provide accurate estimations of automobile mileage. Additionally, we rigorously verified the underlying assumptions of the Multiple Linear Regression model through residual analysis.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for individuals interested in regression analysis, predictive modeling, and automotive industry insights. The documented code and analysis offer a comprehensive view of how to assess the impact of various factors on a dependent variable and construct a reliable predictive model.
